# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code in this repository. Loaded every session — kept lean: **architecture, rules, workflow only**. No examples, no character specifics (those live in `docs/profiles/`).

---

## Project Purpose

A clinical-grade **character profile intelligence system** for storytelling and content creation. Each character is documented as a deep, evidence-backed psychological profile; profiles feed platform-native content.

Built to **scale to many characters** (currently 3). Never hardcode character specifics into shared logic — resolve characters dynamically via `paths.py`.

---

## Architecture

Four domain frameworks + one orchestrator + one common toolkit, wired by an event bus:

```
MAT (Input) → PSY (Analysis) → CRE (Output)
                  ↑ ORC (Orchestration) ↑
            GRO (Growth) ↗ PSY + CRE
```

| Framework | Type         | Domain       | Data location                                         | Purpose                            |
| --------- | ------------ | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **MAT**   | Domain       | Materials    | `docs/materials/`                                     | Evidence ingestion, tiers, CRAAP   |
| **PSY**   | Domain       | Psychology   | `docs/profiles/` + `docs/references/` + `docs/graph/` | Clinical profiling, 5P formulation |
| **CRE**   | Domain       | Content      | `assets/`                                             | Platform content creation          |
| **GRO**   | Domain       | Growth       | `docs/profiles/*/growth/`                             | Career + competency intelligence   |
| **ORC**   | Orchestrator | Coordination | `.claude/`                                            | Event routing, domain boundaries   |
| **COM**   | Common       | Utilities    | `.claude/`                                            | Git, health-check, rules           |

Domain boundaries are enforced: each framework owns its data location and communicates through events, not direct cross-domain writes (Rule 12).

---

## Directory Structure

```
docs/
├── profiles/{character}/   ← 25-file universal nested profile (schema below)
├── materials/{character}/  ← MAT source materials w/ evidence tiers T1–T5 + CRAAP scores
├── references/             ← Clinical theory library (60+ theories), show-don't-tell
├── graph/                  ← Cross-character relational dynamics
└── rules/                  ← 16 modular rule files
plans/{reports,templates}/  ← Validation reports + plan templates
assets/{platform}/          ← CRE output, per platform
```

Asset package convention: `assets/{platform}/{YYMMDD}-{slug}/` → `post.txt`, `image-prompts.txt`, `images/`, `README.txt`.

**Navigation docs:** `docs/knowledge-architecture.md` (6-layer knowledge map), `docs/MODULES.md` (59-skill grouping + cross-framework dependency edges), `docs/distilled-principles.md` (5 cross-domain invariants from rules 01–16).

---

## Profile Structure — Universal Nested Schema

Every character has the **same 25 universal files** so tooling stays character-agnostic:

```
docs/profiles/{character}/
├── INDEX.md                  ← Quick reference
├── CURRENT-STATE.md          ← Current psychological state snapshot
├── milestones.md             ← Key life milestones
├── identity/                 ← core, writing-voice, achievements, media-coverage
├── psychology/               ← formulation (5P), defense-mechanisms, attachment-style,
│                                growth-edges, core-wounds, diagnostics (Big Five + ICD-11),
│                                cultural-formulation, archetype (Jungian + Pia Melody)
├── relationships/            ← family, network, + cross-relationship files
├── timeline/                 ← overview, state-timeline (longitudinal ICD-11 phases)
├── darkness/traumas.md       ← Trauma documentation
├── light/strengths-hope.md   ← Resilience, sources of hope
├── evidence/conversations.md ← Key conversation evidence
└── growth/                   ← career-path (Super), competencies (Dreyfus),
                                 learning-profile (Kolb), mentoring-map (Kram)
```

Cross-relationship files (`relationships/{other-character}.md`) are **optional and per-character**, discovered dynamically via `list_relationship_files()` in `paths.py`. Mirror pairs are bidirectional. Never enumerate them statically in code.

---

## Workflow

**Primary pipeline (event-driven):**

```
MAT.integrated → PSY.refresh → CRE.recalibrate
GRO.assessed | GRO.mentored → PSY.refresh → CRE.recalibrate
```

- **MAT** ingests + classifies sources (5-stage pipeline, evidence tiers T1–T5, CRAAP). Material must be _integrated_ before PSY consumes it — MAT gates block premature analysis.
- **PSY** builds/refreshes the clinical formulation from integrated material + references.
- **GRO** feeds career/competency intelligence into PSY and CRE.
- **CRE** translates the refreshed profile into platform content, gated by evidence tier + confidentiality (Rules 09, 14).
- **ORC** routes events across domains, resolves cascades, audits consistency.

**Profile build protocol:** 3-wave — Foundation → Deep Dive → Validation (Rule 05).

**Design principle:** Scripts do **deterministic gathering** (may over-flag — false positives expected); the LLM does **heuristic judgment**. Never delegate reasoning to scripts.

## Operating Guides (`.claude/skills/_framework-shared/references/`)

Project-owned shared operating references — the cross-framework analogue of cleanmatic's per-skill
`references/`. Skill-specific references live in `{skill}/references/`; cross-skill ones live here.

| Guide | Load | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gates-and-anti-rationalization.md` | **every turn** | High-salience `<GATE-*>` restatement of the self-decision rules + anti-rationalization table |
| `verdict-cache-contract.md` | when running psy:crossref / cre:voice-audit / psy:propagate | re-runnable LLM-verdict cache (lookup-before-judge, `--fresh`, NEVER_CACHED) |
| `skill-doc-spine-template.md` | when authoring skill docs | the 4-doc spine standard (SKILL + README + GUIDE-EN/VI) |
| `{orc,psy,cre,gro,mat,com}-operating-guide.md` | when working in that framework | per-framework skill → trigger → GUIDE routing table (load-on-demand) |

Load on demand: pull a guide only when its skill/flag is active — except `gates-and-anti-rationalization.md`,
loaded every turn. The Skills Catalog below stays the navigational index (not deleted).

---

## Skills Catalog (`.claude/skills/`)

59 framework skills (ORC 17 · PSY 16 · CRE 10 · GRO 8 · MAT 4 · COM 4). Invoke as `{framework}:{skill}`.

> Engineer-kit utility skills (`/ck:*`) installed alongside are **not** catalogued here — they are user-invoked dev tools, discoverable via the harness skill list.

## Operational Notices

**Subagent API retry** — If an Agent-tool result contains a transient API error (`API Error`, `JSON Parse error`, `Unexpected EOF`, `Internal Server Error`, `Service Unavailable`, `ECONNRESET`, `socket hang up`), auto-retry **once** with the identical prompt. Never retry on: `rate_limit`/`429`, `credit`/`billing`, `context_length_exceeded`, `invalid_api_key`.

**Auto-monitoring** — Auto-invoke `com:health-check` for subagents only when the user confirms monitoring OR a health Monitor already runs for the main agent. Never auto-spawn a monitor silently.

**RTK** — Token-optimized CLI proxy (60-90% savings). Hook-based: `git status` → `rtk git status` via PreToolUse. Meta commands: `rtk gain [--history]`, `rtk discover`, `rtk proxy <cmd>`.

**Self-contained** — All skills, agents, hooks, rules, scripts are local under `.claude/`. Global `~/.claude/` is runtime-only (config, cache, sessions).
